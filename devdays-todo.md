ME ME ME

I've spent my carear working on line of business application in enterprises and software houses: (CRM, ERP, BANKING, LOGICSTICS, INSURANCE)

Each application had significant business complexity with hundrands and often thousands of tables, and forms.


So I wanted to build a CRUD application
* Time to market is critical (I want to fail fast)
* Quick turnaround
* - a little about the monolith

What do I need?:
1. Types on the front end
2. Types on the backend
3. Data transfer objects
4. Validations on the front end
5. Validations on the backend
6. Authorization on the front end 
7. Authorization on the API
8. ORM / sql
9. API Routes
10. Live updates across users
11. Query language

Review the list:
1. ORM (prisma etc...)
2. Next JS, remix etc.. are a step right direction because we ca
4. Routes that are glued using:
   1. Graphql
   2. TRPC
   3. Rest API (open api)

I want a single source of truth because:
I want to get things done
I'm lazy
I'm error prone
