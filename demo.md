> Hi I'm Noam honig, and in this video we'll write a full stack Todo app - using React, Node JS & Remult.

> By The end of this video we'll have a working Todo App, with Postgres database, basic Authentication and we'll deploy it to the cloud

---
# Create a full stack app using react, express & remult
---

# Setup

```sh
npm create vite todo-demo -- --template react-ts
```
```sh
cd todo-demo
npm i 
code . // open vs code
```
open terminal
```sh
npm run dev
```
open vite in browser.

---
# We'll start by creating a basic todo list in react
1. Clear app.tsx
2. Delete app.css
3. delete content of index.css
4. add `shared/Task.ts`

---
```ts
function App() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>([
    {id:1, title:"Setup", completed:false }
  ]);
  return <>
    <h1>Todos</h1>
    <main>
      <ul>
        {tasks.map(task => {
          return <li key={task.id}>
            {task.title}
          </li>
        })}
      </ul>
    </main>
  </>
}
```
```html
<input type="checkbox" checked={task.completed}/>
```
---
# Now let's add a backend
install stuff
```sh
npm i express remult
```
```sh
npm i -D @types/express ts-node-dev
```

---

# configuration
> For our node js server, we'll use common js, so we need to remove type-module from the package json

1. `package.json` remove `type`: `module` -  For our node js server, we'll use common js, so we need to remove type-module from the package json***
   
---

2. Create `tsconfig.server.json`
```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```

---
3. Edit `tsconfig.json`, under `compilerOptions` remove `"experimentalDecorators": true`

>If you don't like decorators or prefer javascript, see our docs on how to do so.

---

# Create the Node JS server

1. create server express `src/server/index.ts`
   ```ts
   import express from "express";
   const app = express();
   app.listen(3002, () => console.log("Started"));
   ```
2. Add script to package json
   ```json
   "dev-node":"ts-node-dev -P tsconfig.server.json src/server",
   ```
---
3. Open a new terminal & start the node server
   ```sh
   npm run dev-node
   ```
   > In our docs we explain how to use `concurrently` to run both vite and node js in one terminal
4. create `api.ts` file
5. register it on the server

---
# Entity

> We'll use this TypeScript entity class as a single-source-of-truth for everything our application needs around that entity.

--- 

  - Add the Entity decorators
> The Entity decorator tells Remult that this class will be used as a model for both frontend and backend code, so Remult should create CRUD API endpoints and a database table for this entity. 

---
[ highlight allow api crud ]
>  I’ve told Remult to allow all CRUD operations for the Task entity. Later, I’ll restrict that.


[add field decorators]
> We also have decorators for each field to control its datatype and behavior.

  - Indicate that we support also uuid
---
- Register to API
- Demo get
- Demo post:
  ```json
  { "title":"Setup","completed":true }
  ```
  - Entities
  - Paging, Sorting & Filtering
- Explain that data is saved by default to a json db, and we fully support all databases including ....


---
# Now let's use it in the frontend
---

> To simplify configuration I'll use the proxy feature of vite dev server to forward all requests sent to `/api` - to the backend server that is listening on port 3002 
> 
3. Configure proxy `vite.config.ts`
   ```ts
   server: { proxy: { '/api': 'http://localhost:3002' } }
   ```

4. Demo proxy

---

# use remult to get the data from the server
```tsx
const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task);
```
> we ask Remult to provide us with a repository object for the Task entity. We use this taskRepo object to interact with the backend.

```tsx
useEffect(()=>{
  taskRepo.find().then(setTasks)
},[])
```
--- 
> You can see the GET request generated by this “find” call over here.
---



>Let’s have a closer look at what we can do with this “find” method up here. Right now it just returns all the tasks from the database, but we can easily use it for paging
1. Show limit and page
   1. Show network tab
---
>These definitions go through the REST API request and into the database query on the backend.

2. Show order by
3. Show Where
> you can see that everything here is simple REST API requests
---

# PUNCH!!!
---



# Add new Task
> Let's add the "Add Task" functionality to our app
```ts
const [newTask, setNewTask] = useState("");
```
```html
<input placeholder="What needs to be done"
  value={newTask}
  onChange={e => setNewTask(e.target.value)}
  onKeyDown={e => {
    if (e.key === "Enter")
      addTask()
  }} />
```
---
```ts
const addTask = async () => {
  const task = await taskRepo.insert({
    title:newTask
  })
  setTasks([...tasks, task])
  setNewTask('');
}
```


---


# Add a few tasks
- Create
- Delete
- Update
- Validation
- Backend methods
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Database
- Deployment
---
# Set Completed
```ts
const setCompleted = async (completed: boolean) => {
  const updatedTask = await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed });
  setTasks(tasks.map(t => t === task ? updatedTask : t));
}
```
```tsx
onChange={e => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
```
---

# Edit Task

```ts
const setTitle = async (title: string) => {
  const t = { ...task, title };
  // refactor replace task
  replaceTask(t);
}
```
```ts
const replaceTask = (theTask: Task) => {
  setTasks(tasks.map(t => t === task ? theTask : t));
}
```
```html
<input
  value={task.title}
  onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)} 
  />
```
--- 

# Save Task Edit
```ts
const saveTask = async () => {
  replaceTask(await taskRepo.save(task));
}
```
```ts
onBlur={saveTask}
```
---
# Delete a task
```ts
const deleteTask = async () => {
  await taskRepo.delete(task);
  setTasks(tasks.filter(t => t !== task));
}
```
```tsx
<button onClick={deleteTask} >x</button>
```

--- 
>So, as you can see, using Remult I get full-stack, type-safe CRUD for this whole app, and I didn’t have to write or generate any boilerplate plumbing code. All I needed to do is define the Task entity, register it on the backend, and use Remult’s Repository object on the frontend.

---
# Validation - `Task.ts`

> Now let’s see how, with Remult, I can add data validation to the Task entity, and have it affect both the frontend and the backend.

--- 
> So let’s go over to our Task entity and let’s send an “options” object to the title field decorator and say “validate” and use a predefined “required” validator.

```ts
@Fields.string({
    validate: Validators.required
})
title = '';
```
---

> Let's add try, catch and alert
```ts
const saveTask = async () => {
  try {
    replaceTask(await taskRepo.save(task));
  } catch (err: any) {
    alert(err.message);
  }
}
```
--- 
- Demo
>If I clear the network tab and try again, 
you can see there’s no request being sent to the backend because the validation check is done by javascript running in the browser. 

---
- Demo post call
> Now let’s try to bypass that by sending a POST request to the “tasks” API route with an empty title
> Doesn’t work and I get the same validation error from the API.

---
- Refactor to Arrow Method
> Of course, you don’t have to use a predefined validator, you can use any arrow function to validate the data, 
so I can say for example 
> if task.title.length 
is less than 3 
throw “too short””. 

---

# Let's add a `setAllCompleted` functionality

```ts
const setAllCompleted = async (completed: boolean) => {
  for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
    await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed });
  }
  setTasks(await taskRepo.find());
};
```
```html
  </ul>
  <button onClick={setAllCompleted(true)}>Set All Completed</button>
  <button onClick={setAllCompleted(false)}>Set All UnCompleted</button>
</main>
```
---

# Backend method, refactor to backend
>  looking at the “setAllCompleted” function in the App component. It works but it’s not efficient, because it’s sending multiple requests to update all of these tasks.
 ---
 > One of the nice things about Remult is that we can use the same CRUD syntax both in Frontend code, to interact with the API, and in Backend code, to interact directly with the database.
--- 
>  Let’s refactor this code to run on the backend instead.

--- 

1. Add class `TasksController`
2. Copy setAllCompleted to class
3. Adjust syntax
> The BackendMethod decorator tells Remult that if I call this method from Frontend code, don’t run this code, but instead send an API request and run it on the backend.

4. Register on API
---
6. Call from front end
> And now, in the App component, instead of this loop I can simply say: await TasksController.setAll(completed). That’s it.
7. Show network tab
--- 
> One more important thing we get from this is type-safety for this API call, so if I try to send a string instead of a boolean here, TypeScript tells me I’ve made a mistake.


---
# Authentication 
>Let's see how we can use Remult to control access to the REST API using simple, declarative code.

--- 
>Let’s say I want to restrict the API, so that only authenticated users can create, read and update tasks



```ts
@Entity("tasks", {
    allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated
})
```

--- 
- Show request fail
> As soon as I save this my page will fail because I’m not authenticated. Let’s add a “sign-in” feature so we can make this app usable again.

---
> you can choose any way you like to implement an authentication flow. All you have to tell Remult is how to extract the current user from any incoming request.
  
> For this demo I’m going to use the Express “cookie-session” middleware,

--- 
Add session
```sh
npm i cookie-session
npm i --save-dev @types/cookie-session
```
```ts
import session from 'cookie-session';
//...
app.use(session({
    secret: "my secret"
}));
```
---

# create `server/auth.ts`
```ts
export const auth = Router();
auth.use(json());
const validUsers:UserInfo[] = [
    { id: "1", name: "Jane" },
    { id: "2", name: "Steve" },
];
```
```ts
auth.post('/api/signIn', (req, res) => {
  const user = validUsers.find(user => user.name === req.body.username);
  if (user) {
    req.session!['user'] = user;
    res.json(user);
  } else {
    res.status(404).json("Invalid user, try 'Steve' or 'Jane'")
  }
});
```
--- 
register the `auth` on the server
> Real-life authentication flows can be  more complex than this, but for a demo this will do.

```ts
app.use(auth);
```

---

# Add `Auth.tsx` to `src`
```tsx
const Auth: React.FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
  return <>{children}</>
}

export default Auth;
```
- In main.tsx, wrap with Auth
```ts
<React.StrictMode>
  <Auth>
    <App />
  </Auth>
</React.StrictMode>
```

---
# Back to Auth.tsx
>Now let’s go back to the frontend and add user sign-in.

```ts
const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState<UserInfo>();
if (!currentUser)
  return <>
    <h1>Sign In</h1>
  </>
return <>{children}</>
```
--- 
```tsx
const [username, setUsername] = useState("");
  //...
<main>
  <input value={username}
    onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)}
    placeholder="Type Steve or Jane"
  />
  <button>Sign In</button>
</main>
```

---
# Sign in
```ts
const signIn = async () => {
  const result = await fetch('/api/signIn', {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      'Content-type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ username })
  })
  if (result.ok) {
    setCurrentUser(await result.json())
    setUsername('');
  }
  else
    alert(await result.json());
}
```
```
<button onClick={signIn}>Sign In</button>
```

---
# Demo
1. Still no data
> I need to tell Remult how to extract the current user from a request. For that, I’ll set the getUser option here to a function that returns the “request.session.user”.

getUser:request=>request.session!['user'],

---

# On refresh, it requires signing in again,
## server `auth.ts`
```ts
auth.get("/api/currentUser", (req, res) =>
    res.json(req.session!['user'])
);
```
## Client `Auth.tsx`
```ts
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/currentUser').then(async r => {
    setCurrentUser(await r.json());
  })
}, []);
```

---
# Sign out
server `auth.ts`
```ts
auth.post("/api/signOut", (req, res) => {
  req.session!['user'] = null;
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```
Client `Auth.tsx`
```tsx
const signOut = async () => {
  await fetch('/api/signOut', {method: "POST"});
  setCurrentUser(undefined);
}
```
- continue on the next page

---

```tsx
return <>
  <header style={{
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
    alignItems: 'center'
  }}>
    Hello {currentUser.name} <button>Sign Out</button>
  </header>
  {children}
</>
```

---

# Role-based Authorization
Let’s go back to the Task entity and add another restriction -  only users who have an “admin” role can delete tasks.

```ts
@Entity("tasks", {
  //...
  allowApiDelete:"admin"
})
```
`auth.ts`
```ts
{ id: "1", name: "Jane", roles: ["admin"] },
```
---
# Database

```sh
npm i pg
```

```ts
//...
import { createPostgresConnection } from "remult/postgres";
export const api = remultExpress({
     //...
     dataProvider: createPostgresConnection({
         connectionString: "your connection string"
     }),
});
```
---
# Deployment - adjust the build
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    //...
    "noEmit": false,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src"
  },
  "include": [
      "src/server/index.ts"
  ]
}
```
--- 
# Adjust package json
```
"build": "... && tsc -p tsconfig.server.json",
"start":"node dist/server/"
```
---

# Use express to return the react files
We want to use the same nodejs server to return the static files etc...
```ts
//...
const frontendFiles = process.cwd()+'/dist';
app.use(express.static(frontendFiles));
app.get('/*', (_, res) => {
  res.send(frontendFiles + '/index.html');
});

```

--- 
# Build and test
1. Stop the server terminal
2. npm run build
3. npm run start
   

---
# Replace hard coded strings with environment variables
fix session secret 
```ts
secret: process.env['SESSION_SECRET'] || 'my secret'
